# Dice Game
This is my first Game created using React. It is sleek,smooth and responsive project created using React and Tailwind CSS.
# How To Play
- Select A Number from list and then click on roll on dice.
- if your clicked number and dice number match then congrats your score is  incremented by that matched Number.
- Else you get the -2 for every wrong result.
